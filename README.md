This website will be used to practice spelling English words for elementary school students.

When you enter the page, There should be a "Start" button.  Once clicked, an inbox appears for the student to enter the word they hear.  The word should be spoken (we can use system audio or any method that will reliably work on both mobile and desktop) with a button for "hear it again."  The word should be spoken and then it should be used in a sentence.  For example: "Spell hamburger, as in 'I'd like to eat a hamburger.'"

The inbox will hopefully have a way to prevent auto-correct features of the operating system assisting the student inadvertantly - but this is not important.

On the bottom of the screen should be a caption of "X words correct out of Y words attempted."
